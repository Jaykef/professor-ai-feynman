# Key Frameworks and Architectures

Several frameworks are driving innovation in LLM agent development.  These frameworks provide tools and structures for building, training, and deploying agents.  Key features include:

* **Modular Design:**  Allows for easy customization and extensibility.
* **Task Decomposition:**  Helps agents break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
* **Memory Management:**  Enables agents to retain and utilize context over time.
* **Reinforcement Learning Integration:**  Facilitates training agents through interaction and feedback.

Examples of such frameworks *(Note:  Specific framework names omitted due to no search capabilities)*:  These will vary depending on current research and development.  Focus on illustrating the *kinds* of capabilities mentioned above.
